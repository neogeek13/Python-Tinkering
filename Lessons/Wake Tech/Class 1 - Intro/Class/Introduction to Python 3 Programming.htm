<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Hello! Welcome to <em>Introduction to Python&nbsp;3 Programming</em>. My name is Mike Orsega, and I'll be working with you over the next few weeks as we learn the art of charming a Python.</p>
<p><img style="display:none" class="pf_placeholder_image" title="hidden image or multimedia element" alt="hidden image or multimedia element" src="Introduction%20to%20Python%203%20Programming_files/pf_placeholder_a.png" border="0"><img alt="python" src="Introduction%20to%20Python%203%20Programming_files/python-logo.gif" style="float: right;" galleryimg="no" class="pf_image">This
 class, of course, has nothing to do with charming a snake. Python, as 
you know, is software. Although many believe Python got its name from 
the snake known for constricting its prey, the origin of its name is 
much less ominous. The name actually comes from the British comedy 
group, Monty Python. </p>
<p>The official Python website describes the software as "a dynamic 
object-oriented programming language that can be used for many kinds of 
software development." One thing that is fantastic about Python is its 
power when working with data. Python's creators really made it quick and
 easy to do fairly complex things. You can use it to write simple, short
 scripts that consist of a few lines of instructions to perform some 
action. And you can use it to write larger, more complex programs that 
resemble those written in languages such as C or Java. </p>
<p>Plus, Python code can be run on a wide variety of machines, including
 Windows, Linux/Unix, Macintosh, and even certain personal digital 
assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones. The possibilities of places to run 
your code seem nearly endless. All of this makes Python a powerful 
programming tool. So, my job is tough because there's just so much 
material. I can't cover everything (although I'd like to). </p>
<p>So, before we get too far into this, I want to give you an idea of 
who this course is designed for. I'm really gearing this course for 
those of you who want an introduction to the basics of Python and what 
it has to offer. That means we'll cover basic decision and repetition 
structures and functions. We'll also hit on some of the object-oriented 
parts of Python, as well as files, exceptions, lists, tuples, and 
dictionaries. We're even going to throw in some graphics to keep things 
interesting.</p>
<p>I'm excited about what we're going to cover. It may seem like a lot, 
but I know we can do this together. I say this with confidence because 
I've been working as a programmer and teaching others about programming 
languages for years. </p>
<p>My background is pretty much in the traditional programming 
languages. I've programmed in Java, C++, C#, and Visual Basic. I also 
have experience with MPI (a multiprocessor programming language) and 
Alice (a tool used to help teach introductory programming concepts to 
new students). In fact, I have three other online courses. They are: <em>Introduction to C# Programming</em>, <em>Intermediate C# Programming</em>, and <em>Introduction to Alice Programming</em>. </p>
<p>At any rate, this course won't be about the logic of programming. 
Instead, I'll assume that you've either had some of this in a prior 
course or that you've programmed before in another language. This will 
give us the opportunity to really focus on the unique features of Python
 and learn its syntax.</p>
<p>We'll start by going through a brief overview of programming 
languages, so that you'll get an idea of where Python fits in. Next, 
we'll talk about IDLE, the development environment that comes along with
 the Python download. I'll show you some of its important features and 
where you'll write your code and where you'll run it. Finally, we'll 
finish up this lesson by writing a small Python program.</p>
<p>One piece of advice before we begin is to be aware that my goal in 
this course is to teach you the fundamentals of Python—the building 
blocks. This means two things. First, the programs we'll create during 
the lessons and for the assignments may not be exactly what you'd find 
in the real world. These are problems that are designed to let you 
practice what you learn in each lesson.</p>
<p>Second, you're more likely to learn this material if you have your 
own ideas of how to apply the concepts. That is, I'll do my best to give
 you ideas for interesting programs that use this material, but what's 
interesting to me may not be interesting to you. So, as you read through
 the text, I challenge you to try to think of programs that you might 
like to write that use what we discuss. The more you practice, the 
easier this will be and the better at charming Python you'll become.</p>
<p>Now it's time we move on to Chapter 2 and take a closer look at Python.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="location_name_printer_friendly_chp02">

                        <h3>
                            Chapter 2</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p><!-- ipy LESSON 01 CHAPTER 2 --><!-- START CHAPTER CONTENT --><strong>What Is Python?</strong></p>
<p>The software's creator, Guido van Rossum, developed Python as a 
higher-level language that allows programmers to use commands that look 
like human language. Of course, since the computer can't understand the 
language that we use, other programs exist that reduce a high-level 
language to something computers can understand. </p>
<p>There are two types of programs that do this translation. One type, called <em>interpreters</em>, translates the high-level code, one line at a time, as the program is running. This is different from a <em>compiler</em>, which will go through the entire program and translate everything at once. </p>
<p>Many common programming languages today use a compiler such as Java, 
C++, C#, and Visual Basic. Others use an interpreter. For the most part,
 Python is an interpreted language. Unfortunately, this definition can 
get a little muddy when it comes to Python, and this can lead to a long 
discussion, which I'd prefer not to get into in this course. Instead, 
let's just keep in mind that Python code can be run one line at a time 
through an interpreter.</p>
<p>So now you might be thinking, "What makes Python so special and so 
different?" To answer that question, we need to head back to the origins
 of Python. Remember Mr. van Rossum? The short story is that he wanted a
 simple, easy to use programming language. So, Python uses English-like 
syntax, and it doesn't use curly braces { } to block out its code. 
Instead it favors simple white space indenting.</p>
<p>Now, the last couple of sentences make me realize that we're getting 
ahead of ourselves a bit already. Just remember, Python was intended to 
be easy to read and easy to write. However, in addition to being simple,
 it also gives programmers the ability to implement more complex 
concepts, such as object-oriented programming and exception handling. </p>
<p>There are also some really nice built-in types for us to use in our 
code. But again, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves. We need to 
lay a solid foundation of the basics before we start into the more 
advanced topics.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let's turn our attention to the development environment that you'll be working with: IDLE.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="location_name_printer_friendly_chp03">
                    <div class="printer-friendly-location-name">
                        <h3>
                            Chapter 3</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p><!-- ipy LESSON 01 CHAPTER 3 --><!-- START CHAPTER CONTENT --><strong>IDLE</strong></p>
<p>While there are a few different versions of Python, the one we'll use
 in this class comes from the Python Software Foundation (PSF) at 
www.python.org. This is sometimes called CPython because the interpreter
 is written in the C programming language. Although, lately folks have 
taken the C to stand for <em>classic</em>. Instead of going into a long 
discussion about this, let's just say that we're using the Python from 
PSF and go about the business of learning how to program with it.</p>
<p>One nice feature in the Python download is that it comes with an <em>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</em>.
 The IDE is a program that will allow us to write and run our Python 
code within the same application. In Python, this environment is called <em>IDLE</em>. Some claim the term IDLE actually comes from Eric Idle, one of the members of the comedy group Monty Python. </p>
<p>No matter where the name comes from, the upshot is that we'll be 
using IDLE in here for development. However, if you have another IDE 
that you think is better than IDLE, please feel free to use it. I've 
used a few others myself, but I've found that for teaching purposes, 
IDLE works best for me. It's clean, simple, and fairly easy to work 
with, just like Python. Plus, it comes with the language's download.</p>
<p>I think it's time we get started! If you haven't already visited the Python site at <a href="http://www.python.org/download/" target="_blank">http://www.python.org/download/</a>
 and downloaded Python, do so now. This course was developed using 
Python 3.2, so you should consider using the most recent 3.2 release 
when working through this material.</p>
<p>The first thing you'll note when you get to the download page is the 
wide range of choices for downloads. There are multiple choices 
depending on your operating system (OS) and processor. Like most people,
 I suspect you'll want the Windows download for x86 processors. But of 
course, if you have a Macintosh or are running Linux on your computer, 
you can certainly get Python for these operating systems as well. After 
all, this is one of the nice features of Python—you can develop Python 
programs on different platforms.</p>
<p>Once you have your file downloaded, run it and complete the 
installation. For those of you Windows folks out there, you should now 
have an item called Python 3.2 in the list of items in your Start Menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display:none" class="pf_placeholder_image" title="hidden image or multimedia element" alt="hidden image or multimedia element" src="Introduction%20to%20Python%203%20Programming_files/pf_placeholder_a.png" border="0"><img style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border: 0px solid;" alt="Windows Start Menu item for Python 2.5" src="Introduction%20to%20Python%203%20Programming_files/L01-01.gif" galleryimg="no" class="pf_image"><br>
<font size="1">Windows Start Menu item for Python 3.2</font></p>
<p>You'll notice that in addition to having links for documentation and 
to uninstall Python, there seem to be two different Pythons: IDLE, which
 we've discussed, and the <em>command line</em>. As I've said, this 
course is going to work exclusively with IDLE. But just for fun, let's 
spend a minute or two with the command line. And in case you don't have 
experience working with an interpreter, this little exercise will 
highlight how one works.</p>
<p>Open Python (command line) and you'll be presented with that old, 
boring black window with the white text. Here, you'll see a couple of 
interesting things. First is the exact version of Python you're using. 
Also, you'll see three greater than signs (&gt;&gt;&gt;). This is the 
Python prompt. When you see this, it means you can enter Python code to 
be run. Let's try it out by typing this classic code:</p>
<div class="noscroll">
<pre>print("Hello world!")</pre>
</div>
<p>Please note, Python is a <em>case-sensitive</em> language. Therefore, typing <em>print</em> is different from typing <em>Print</em>. Only the all-lowercase print will work here.</p>
<p>Press ENTER and you'll see the words <em>Hello world!</em> printed on
 the next line, followed by another prompt. Okay, maybe not too 
exciting. But it does demonstrate that Python is an interpreted 
language. That is, we're only translating one line of code at a time. 
Don't believe me? Well, try typing this:</p>
<div class="noscroll">
<pre>phrase = "Hello world!"<br>print(phrase)</pre>
</div>
<p>You'll note that the first line is storing those words in a variable named phrase. The second line tells the computer to print out the value of that variable. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display:none" class="pf_placeholder_image" title="hidden image or multimedia element" alt="hidden image or multimedia element" src="Introduction%20to%20Python%203%20Programming_files/pf_placeholder_a.png" border="0"><img style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border: 0px solid;" alt="Command window after executing statements" src="Introduction%20to%20Python%203%20Programming_files/L01-02.gif" galleryimg="no" class="pf_image"><br>
<font size="1">Command window after executing statements</font></p>
<p>At this point, you may have lots of questions about output, variables, and syntax. Again, there's going to be plenty of time to explore these topics in the coming weeks. For now, we're just getting a little practice playing with the interpreter. </p>
<p>Be sure to keep this tool in mind as the course progresses. There may be times you won't want to type out a complete program. Instead you'll want to try a couple things just to see the results. The command line interpreter is a great place to go for this.</p>
<p>Now that you've gotten your feet wet with the Python language, let's move on to Chapter 4 where we'll create more short programs and get acquainted with IDLE.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="location_name_printer_friendly_chp04">
                    <div class="printer-friendly-location-name">
                        <h3>
                            Chapter 4</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p><!-- ipy LESSON 01 CHAPTER 4 --><!-- START CHAPTER CONTENT --><strong>Python Programming in IDLE</strong></p>
<p>Now we're ready to play with IDLE a little bit. If you haven't already shut down your command line window, do it now by clicking the X in the upper-right corner of the window. Next, open IDLE.</p>
<p>You're probably thinking this is the same thing we saw in Chapter 3, except now we're looking at a white background with black text, instead of the other way around. And this is somewhat true. After all, once again there are those three greater than signs that are our prompt. In fact, if you go back and type those statements I had you type in the last chapter, you'll see that you get the exact same result.</p>
<p>Ah, but IDLE is so much more. For one thing, you'll notice at the top of the window there's a list of menu items. We won't talk about most of these items in this course, but one of them is very important. </p>
<p>Go ahead and select <strong>File &gt; New File&nbsp;</strong>(those using a version before Python 3.3 should select <strong>File &gt; New Window</strong>). You'll now get a very uninspiring new window that looks nearly identical to the first, with one major exception—there's no prompt. In fact, you'll find that it looks very similar to Microsoft's built-in text editor, Notepad. But then again, that's all this is. It's a place to type in plain text. It's just that our plain text has a special syntax. Python syntax. </p>
<p>To get some practice with this, let's go ahead and type the classic Hello World! program code again. Simply go to your blank file and type the following:</p>
<div class="noscroll">
<pre>print("Hello world!")</pre>
</div>
<p>Did you notice anything special? The letters in your words changed colors. The word <em>print</em> should have turned purple and the text <em>Hello World!</em> should have turned green. This is one of the nice features of our editor here in IDLE. It's going to give us visual cues to help us with our programs.</p>
<p>The reason print turned purple is because it's a <em>keyword</em>, or a <em>reserved word</em>, in Python. That means it has a special meaning, and we won't be able to use it as a variable name. Otherwise, Python will get confused and won't be able to run the code.</p>
<p>The Hello World! turned green to designate that the text is a <em>literal string</em>. In general, a string is just a collection of letters. The reason we're calling this a literal string is because we want to literally see the phrase Hello World! on the screen. </p>
<p>By coloring these letters green, it makes it a lot easier to tell what's in the string. I think this is going to be a feature that'll come in handy for you as you write your programs. It helps me a lot.</p>
<p>So, now you have your very first Python program written. Let's run it and see what it does. You might think at this point that all you have to do is click <strong>Run &gt; Run Module</strong>, which makes complete sense to me. The problem is that Python requires that you save your program before running it. Go ahead and double check me on this. Try to run the file and you should get a dialog box that looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display:none" class="pf_placeholder_image" title="hidden image or multimedia element" alt="hidden image or multimedia element" src="Introduction%20to%20Python%203%20Programming_files/pf_placeholder_a.png" border="0"><img style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border: 0px solid;" alt="Save Before Run dialog box" src="Introduction%20to%20Python%203%20Programming_files/L01-03.gif" galleryimg="no" class="pf_image"><br>
<font size="1">Save Before Run dialog box</font></p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> so that you can save the file. Python will give you another dialog box that allows you to choose the file name and where it is to be saved. My suggestion is to create a new folder someplace where you'll easily find it, perhaps the Desktop or My Documents. Then inside that folder, create a new folder for each of our lessons in this course. </p>
<p>There is one thing that is very important to note. When you're naming your file, be sure to include the .py file extension in the filename. If you don't, you'll still be able to run the Python program, however, IDLE will think it's just a regular file and not a Python file. So, you'll lose the coloring and some of the other nice visual cues that IDLE provides. </p>
<p>As soon as you've saved the file, IDLE will run the code for you. Notice now how control switches back over to the original window that we saw when we first opened IDLE. This should make sense though. After all, this is where the prompt was, right? Going back and forth between the window where your program source code is located and the window where your program runs may seem strange at first, but as our time together goes by, you'll get used to it.</p>
<p>Let's turn our attention to our last chapter and wrap things up.</p>
                </div>

<p>Today, you gained some insight into the world of Python. You entered code on the command line interpreter and had a chance to work with IDLE a bit. Hopefully, you're excited to learn more because I'm eager to move forward! </p>
<p>In our next lesson, we'll continue our work in Python by learning about variables and how to perform mathematical operations. Variables are extremely important because there are many times when you'll want to keep track of some data while your program runs. This is especially important if you plan to get input from your users, because that input data needs to be stored somewhere for use later. We'll also touch on math because there are sure to be times when you'll need to do a little bit of math in your programs. So, we'll take some time to practice. </p>
<p>Don't forget to post any questions you might have in the Discussion Area. In fact, I'd love it if you took the time to say hello and introduce yourself. My hope is that you'll use the Discussion Area often and that we'll learn a lot together. To get to the Discussion Area, click the <strong>Discussion</strong> link.</p>

                <h3>
                    FAQs</h3>
            </div>
            <strong>Q:</strong> I followed your instructions in the text and saved my Hello World! program file with the name, <em>hello.py</em>.  However, when I double-click this file on my computer's Desktop, a black window appears for a fraction of a second and then disappears.  How come it doesn't stay up long enough for me to read it?<br>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> The reason that this black window appears and disappears so quickly is because when the program is run this way, the computer will open a new command window, put the output text there and then close the window immediately.<br>
<br>
Even though it's perfectly acceptable to run your Python programs by double-clicking the file on your computer, this isn't something that I recommend doing for this course.  Instead, you should start IDLE and use File &gt; Open to locate the .py file and run it from there.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Q:</strong> When I type my Python code in IDLE, the words don't change colors.  Have I done something wrong?<br>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Most likely, the reason that your letters aren't changing colors is because you haven't saved your file with the file extension .py.  Just choose <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong> and be sure to type out the full file name.  For example, <em>Hello.py</em>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Are we required to submit our assignments to you for grading? If so, how and where do we do that?<br>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> There's no requirement, and really no mechanism, for you to submit your work to me for grading. Instead, these exercises are sort of self-grading; your programs will either work or they won't. The only requirement for you to get your Completion Certificate is to pass the final exam.<br>
<br>
Actually, you'll find as you get into the course that I've included <em>sample solutions</em> along the way. Please do not view these programs as the way I expect you to solve the problems; each sample solution is just one possible way. Many times I learn so much by viewing other people's code, which is why I've included these programs.

            Write a short Python program that prints multiple lines of text using two or more print statements.  You might consider printing your name and the names of five of your favorite movies or songs.
